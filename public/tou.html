In addition, some services offered through the Service may be subject to additional terms and conditions promulgated by Brave from time to time; your use of such services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are incorporated into these Terms of Use by this reference. </p> 
                    
                    <p>Brave may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time.  This provision is void where prohibited by law and the right to access the Service is revoked in such jurisdictions.</p>

                    <h3>Modification of Terms of Use</h3>
                    <p>Brave reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any of the Terms of Use, or change, suspend, or discontinue the Service (including without limitation, the availability of any feature, database, or content) at any time by posting a notice on the Brave websites or Service or by sending you an email.  Brave may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Service without notice or liability.  It is your responsibility to check the Terms of Use periodically for changes.  Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to the Terms of Use constitutes acceptance of those changes.</p>

                    <h3>Brave Browser License</h3>

For purposes of the Terms of Use, the term &#8220;Content&#8221; includes, without limitation, any information, data, text, photographs, videos, software, scripts, graphics, and interactive features generated, provided, or otherwise made accessible on or through the Service. By way of example, and not as a limitation, you shall not (and shall not permit any third party to) take any action (including contributing any Content) that: would constitute a violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation;  infringes any intellectual property or other right of any other person or entity;  is threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, libelous, deceptive, fraudulent, invasive of another's privacy, tortious, obscene, offensive, or profane; constitutes unauthorized or unsolicited advertising, junk or bulk e-mail; contains software viruses or any other similar computer codes, files, or programs; or impersonates any person or entity.</p>

                    <p>Further, you shall not (directly or indirectly): (i) take any action that imposes or may impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on Brave&#8217;s (or its third party providers&#8217;) infrastructure; or (ii) interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Service or any activities conducted on the Service; (iii) bypass any measures Brave may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service (or parts thereof).</p>

                    <h3>Trademarks; Patents</h3>

All other trademarks mentioned in this website are the property of their respective owners. The trademarks and logos displayed on this website may not be used without the prior written consent of Brave or their respective owners.  Portions, features and/or functionality of Brave's products may be protected under Brave patent applications or patents.</p>

                    <h3>Termination</h3>
                    <p>Brave may terminate your access to all or any part of the Service at any time if you fail to comply with these Terms of Use, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your account.  Further, either party may terminate the Services for any reason and at any time upon written notice.  If you wish to terminate your account, you may do so by following the instructions on the Service.  Any fees paid hereunder are non-refundable.

                    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
                    <p>ALL USE OF THE SERVICE AND ANY CONTENT IS UNDERTAKEN ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.  THE SERVICE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE BRAVE BROWSER AND ANY CONTENT) IS PROVIDED &#8220;AS IS&#8221; AND &#8220;AS AVAILABLE&#8221; AND IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES IMPLIED BY ANY COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE, ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED.  SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

                    <h3>Indemnification</h3>
                    <p>You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Brave, its affiliates and each of its, and its affiliates employees, contractors, directors, suppliers and representatives from all liabilities, losses, claims, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that arise from or relate to (i) your use or misuse of, or access to, the Service, or (ii) your violation of the Terms of Use or any applicable law, contract, policy, regulation or other obligation.  Brave reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will assist and cooperate with Brave in connection therewith.</p>

                    <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
                    <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL BRAVE OR ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS OR CONTENT PROVIDERS, BE LIABLE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE (I) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, OR SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, (II) FOR YOUR RELIANCE ON THE SERVICE OR (III) FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES IN EXCESS (IN THE AGGREGATE) OF THE FEES PAID BY YOU FOR THE SERVICE OR, IF GREATER, $500.  SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

                    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
                    <p>The Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and Brave with respect to the Service, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and Brave with respect to the Service.  If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.  The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Brave shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder due to any cause beyond Brave&#8217;s reasonable control.  The Terms of Use are personal to you, and are not assignable or transferable by you except with Brave's prior written consent.  Brave may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent.  No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of the Terms of Use and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect.  Except as otherwise provided herein, all notices under the Terms of Use will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or two days after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.</p>

                    <h3>Copyright Dispute Policy</h3>
                    <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the &#8220;DMCA&#8221;) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.  If you believe in good faith that any Content made available in connection with the Service infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the Content be removed, or access to it blocked as set forth below (see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for further details).  It is Brave&#8217;s policy to (1) block access to or remove material that it believes in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users; and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders. The address of Brave&#8217;s Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (&#8220;Designated Agent&#8221;) is listed at the end of this policy.</p>

                    <p><strong>A. Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements:</strong>  If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Brave Service infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:  1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;                 2. Identification of works or materials being infringed; 3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that Brave is capable of finding and verifying its existence; 4. Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, e-mail address; 5. A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (3) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and 6. A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.</p>

                    <p><strong>B. Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent:</strong>  It is Brave&#8217;s policy: 1. to remove or disable access to the infringing material; 2. to notify the content provider, member or user that it has removed or disabled access to the material; and 3. that repeat offenders will have the infringing material removed from the system and that Brave will terminate such content provider&#8217;s, member&#8217;s or user&#8217;s access to the service.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>C. Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:</strong>   If the content provider, member or user believes that the material that was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner&#8217;s agent, or pursuant to the law, the content provider, member or user must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:  1. A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user; 2. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled; 3. A statement that the content provider, member or user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the material; and 4. Content provider&#8217;s, member&#8217;s or user&#8217;s name, address, telephone number, and, if available, e-mail address and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider&#8217;s, member&#8217;s or user&#8217;s address is located, or if the content provider&#8217;s, member&#8217;s or user&#8217;s address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Brave is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</p>

                    <p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Brave&#8217;s may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Brave may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Brave&#8217;s discretion.</p>

                    <p><strong>Notices and counter notices with respect to the Service should be sent to Brave at:</strong>
